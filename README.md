Grayscale CIFAR-10 Image Classification using TensorFlow

Description

This project focuses on classifying CIFAR-10 images converted to grayscale using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow.
The workflow includes preprocessing the data, training a neural network, evaluating performance, and analyzing misclassifications using a confusion matrix.

Project Highlights
